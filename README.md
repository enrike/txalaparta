this is just a bunch of scripts to research the txalaparta rhythms by implementing them into a digital system.

note that this is a ongoing research project suffering constant changes atm!

there are two main directions atm :

- auto txalaparta : a program that generates txalaparta-like rhtythms that can  be controlled from a GUI

- interactive txalaparta : an interactive txalaparta that listens to a txalaparta plaey input (via mic) and responds. the response has two different modes
		- imitation: tries to play exactly what listens
		- learning: using markov chains it tries to learn from the input and responds according to the learnt patterns and style
