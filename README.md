This is just a bunch of scripts to research the txalaparta rhythms by implementing them into a digital system. It is part of the Doctoral research by Enrike Hurtado.

There are two main apps :

- auto txalaparta : a program that generates txalaparta-like rhythms that can be controlled from a GUI

- interactive txalaparta : an interactive txalaparta that listens to a txalaparta play input (via mic). It tries to learn from the input and responds according to the patterns and style learnt

* How to run:
Both programs are created with Supercollider. You need to install Supercollider to run them. It also requieres Chromagram and WAmp extensions part of the SC3plugins.
